## My process
  first I design the mobile version, then scaled to the desktop version.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

During this project I strengthened my knowledge of flex design.
I'm proud of how the cart button turned out

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```#cart-btn{
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 10px;
    background-color: var(--Dark-cyan);
    color: var(--White);
    font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    }
```

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about flex design and grid, because I feel that I still don't take advantage of all the potential that they can give me as a frontend developer.
Also, feel that I'm redundant with my CSS. I think i can make it more ordered and clean.
